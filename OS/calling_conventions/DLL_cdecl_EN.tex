\subsection{Cdecl example: a DLL}
\label{cdecl_DLL}

Let's back to the fact that this is not very important how to declare the \verb|main()| function: \myref{main_arguments}.

This is a real story: once upon a time I wanted to replace an original DLL file in some software by mine.
First I enumerated names of all DLL exports and made a function in my own replacement DLL for each function in the original DLL, like:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc]
void function1 ()
{
	write_to_log ("function1() called\n");
};
\end{lstlisting}

I wanted to see, which functions are called during run, and when.
However, I was in hurry and had no time to deduce arguments count for each function, let alone data types.
So each function in my replacement DLL had no argumnts whatsoever.
But everything worked, because all functions had \emph{cdecl} calling convention.
(It wouldn't work if functions had \emph{stdcall} calling convention.)
It also worked for x64 version.

And then I did a next step: I deduced argument types for some functions.
But I made several mistakes, for example, the original function took 3 arguments, but I knew only about 2, etc.

Still, it worked.
At the beginning, my replacement DLL just ignored all arguments.
Then, it ignored the 3rd argument.
