\subsection{Relocs in ARM64}
\label{ARM64_relocs}

As we know, there are 4-byte instructions in ARM64, so it is impossible to write a large number into a register
using a single instruction.

Nevertheless, an executable image can be loaded at any random address in memory, so that's why relocs exists.
Read more about them (in relation to Win32 PE): \myref{subsec:relocs}.

\myindex{ARM!\Instructions!ADRP/ADD pair}

The address is formed using the \TT{ADRP} and \ADD instruction pair in ARM64.

The first loads a 4KiB-page address and the second one adds the remainder.
Let's compile the example from \q{\HelloWorldSectionName} 
(\lstref{hw_c}) in GCC (Linaro) 4.9 under win32:

\lstinputlisting[caption=GCC (Linaro) 4.9 and objdump of object file,style=customasmARM]{patterns/ARM/relocs1.lst}

So there are 3 relocs in this object file.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
The first one takes the page address, cuts the lowest 12 bits and writes the remaining high 21 bits
to the \TT{ADRP} instruction's bit fields. This is because we don't need to encode the low 12 bits,
and the \INS{ADRP} instruction has space only for 21 bits.

\item 
The second one puts the 12 bits of the address relative to the page start into the \ADD instruction's bit fields.

\item 
The last, 26-bit one, is applied to the instruction at address \TT{0x10} where the 
jump to the \printf function is.

All ARM64 (and in ARM in ARM mode) instruction addresses have zeros in the two lowest bits
(because all instructions have a size of 4 bytes),
so one have to encode only the highest 26 bits of 28-bit address space ($\pm 128$MB).

\end{itemize}

There are no such relocs in the executable file: because it's known where the \q{Hello!} string
is located, in which page, and the address of \puts is also known.

So there are values set already in the \TT{ADRP}, \ADD and \TT{BL} instructions
(the linker has written them while linking):

\lstinputlisting[caption=objdump of executable file,style=customasmARM]{patterns/ARM/relocs2.lst}

\myindex{ARM!\Instructions!BL}

As an example, let's try to disassemble the BL instruction manually.\\
\TT{0x97ffffa0} is $0b10010111111111111111111110100000$.
According to \InSqBrackets{\ARMSixFourRef C5.6.26}, \emph{imm26} is the last 26 bits:\\
$imm26 = 0b11111111111111111110100000$.
It is \TT{0x3FFFFA0}, but the \ac{MSB} is 1, 
so the number is negative, and we can convert it manually to convenient form for us.
By the rules of negation (\myref{sec:signednumbers:negation}), just invert all bits: (it is \TT{0b1011111=0x5F}), and add 1 (\TT{0x5F+1=0x60}).
So the number in signed form is \TT{-0x60}.
Let's multiply \TT{-0x60} by 4 (because address stored in opcode is divided by 4): it is \TT{-0x180}.
Now let's calculate destination address: \TT{0x4005a0} + (\TT{-0x180}) = \TT{0x400420} 
(please note: we consider the address of the BL instruction, not the current value of \ac{PC}, which may be different!).
So the destination address is \TT{0x400420}.\\
